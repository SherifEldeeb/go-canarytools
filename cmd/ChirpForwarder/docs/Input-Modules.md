Input Modules (also known as feeders in the code) are the components that fetch, or receive, alerts from the Canary Console, the feed them to subsequent components (which are the `filters` in the pipeline).
Currently, the only supported input module is `consoleapi`; support for `syslog` and `webhook` feeders are planned for the future.
